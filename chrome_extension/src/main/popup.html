    <p>
    Treehouse helps you find new Subreddits by showing you the timeline of submissions for links on Reddit.

    Look out for the green tables under Reddit links to external sites e.g. Imgur, which will lead you to parts of Reddit, and the Internet who share an appreciation for the linked content.

    <h3>About Treehouse</h3>

    <p>
    This extension works by having your browser request submission histories for each link on your page.
    In order to figure out how to make Treehouse more useful and fun, I collect some anonymous data on usage patterns.
